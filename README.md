# MaskDeepLearning
created a deep neural network to detect if the face in an image is wearing a mask or not.
The data is a directory containing two sub-directories. One with images that have masks and one with images that have no masks.

You will load in the images into training and testing datasets and then build a deep neural network to classify the images.

The notebook contains code to read in the data into datasets that are built for Keras functions. You can directly use them in calls to model.fit

Report your classification accuracy, confusion matrix, and f-scores.
